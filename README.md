# Observational Astrophysics

Example code for ASTR341 at Haverford College. See Notebooks for acknowledgements to other example code I worked from, but particular thanks to Coleman Krawczyk. 

<b>Working with FLI Proline CCD Data.ipynb</b> - Jupyter Notebook with some examples of python image analysis using the Haverford College FLI Proline CCD. Shows how to do most of the analysis needed for the CCD Characterisation

<b>AperturePhotometryAstropy.ipynb</b> - Jupyter notebook working through Astropy Multi-object photometry using the data in the PerseusClusterImages directory.


<b>Basic Image Manipulation.ipynb</b> - Jupyter Notebook showing worked examples of combining fits images into a three colour image


<b>Working with SBIG CCD Data.ipynb</b> - Jupyter Notebook with some basic examples of analysis from the Haverford College SBIG CCD. 

<b>gaia-HR Diagram.ipynb</b> - New for 2022 - a python notebook based on an astropy tutorial which walks through plotting HR diagrams using Gaia data, and also cross matching stars observed with our 16" (output corr.fits is from astrometry.net analysis of one of our CCD images) with Gaia archival data.
